# Chenyun Final Dashboard

This project presents an interactive dashboard exploring the relationship between PTSD symptoms and blood pressure metrics collected through an app-based study.

## Project Overview
We investigated how PTSD symptom severity (measured by PCL5 scores) relates to morning systolic blood pressure and blood pressure variability. Understanding these patterns can help inform interventions that aim to reduce cardiovascular risk in populations experiencing chronic psychological stress.

## Dashboard Contents
- **PTSD Symptoms vs. Morning Systolic Blood Pressure**:  
  Interactive scatter plot showing the trend between PTSD levels and morning blood pressure values.
- **Participant Data Table**:  
  Searchable and sortable table displaying participant IDs, PTSD scores, and blood pressure readings.

The dashboard is organized into tabs for easy navigation and supports exploratory data analysis through interactive hover tooltips and sorting features.

## Data Description
- **Datasets**: `Lifepak_Stress` and `Lifepak_Sleep 2`
- **Source**: Internal app-based study (confidential, not publicly available)
- **Sample Size**: ~300 participants
- **Collection Method**: Self-reported surveys and wearable device data
- **Collection Period**: 2022â€“2023

## Real-World Impact
This project highlights the association between PTSD symptoms and blood pressure variability, an important early marker of cardiovascular risk. Understanding these patterns can guide more targeted interventions to improve heart health in individuals experiencing chronic psychological stress.
